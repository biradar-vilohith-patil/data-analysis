z-score = xi - mu / std
for analysing outliers


There are 2 types of outliers 
1.Due to error entry in the data 
2.Due to natural variation in the data 

you must Remove 1. but can keep 2. 

There are two types of outliers :
- Outliers due to variability in data or not due to experimental errors
- Outliers due to experimental errors
- You must handle outliers due to experimental errors by removing them from the dataset.


-- We can make the outliers less significant by applying transformations like log transformation, square root transformation etc. --
Handling outliers:
1. Remove outliers
2. Transform data:
    - Log Transformation - np.[fun]
    - Power Transformation - sklearn :
          1. Box - cox
          2. yeo - johnson 

-- Whenever you want to analyse the two categorical columns, use Chi-Square test --
-- Whenever you want to analyse the two numerical columns, use Anova test --
